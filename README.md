### Source: Wicked Cool Shell Scripts - Dave Taylor

A very useful script for analyzing the traffic to a website by analyzing the logs of the Apache web server. It shows the top 10 most popular pages of the site, and the top 10 referrers for visits to the site

Requires Apache to be installed, and root access to be able to access the log files.
